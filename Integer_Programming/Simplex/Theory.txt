Theory 1: simplex implementation cannot account for the case that the first feasible solution
offered by phase 1 could be optimal.
	After phase 1, program is forced to pivot. Would not it be apparent that the current tableau has no 
	positive reduced cost values? Should that always be accounted for before a pivot?

Theory 2: simplex implementation cannot account for there being only one point in the feasible region.
	More likely scenario is the program calls pivot and finds that it can't find an exiting variabl that
	will allow for no zero change entering variable. I don't think the program is equipped to handle this
	scenario and might force itself to pivot. Doesn't my implementation of bland's rule force that to happen?
	Bland's rule tells one how to pivot out of degnerate points. Wouldn't a zero b value always lock out
	any positive change in a variable? This paradox may be resolved once I fix this bug.
